A drive activity light utility for Windows and the technically paranoid.

This utility is built for and targets the .NET 2.0 library. It has been
built and tested with .NET 4.0 as well, and works fine. It even runs 
well on Windows 8, and as far back as Windows XP.

This utility was originally written because the brains at Dell decided
that on the back of their XPS 15 laptop, where you can't see it with
the display open, would be a good place to locate the drive access LED.
I am addicted to the drive access LED, so I know if my machine is busy
or just siting there thumbing its nose at me.

As it turns out, this utility is very handy where you don't get a 
drive access light, such as on VMs (I use it on Azure VMs as well as
more traditional VMs), ad on Windows-based tablets like the Microsoft 
Surface.

Have fun. Hack away.
